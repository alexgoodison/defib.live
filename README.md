# defib.live

Defib.live was created out of necessity. The island of Ireland needed a comprehensive, user-friendly defibrillator map that had the potential to become a  household name across the country. My sole intention for this website, is to never leave anyone asking themselves, where is my nearest defibrillator?

This web app was created in 2022 using Svelte and MongoDB.
